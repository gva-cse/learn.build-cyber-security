In the first week of the course, I was introduced to fundamental Azure topics by Mukesh SIR. We covered various aspects such as:

Azure Fundamentals: Azure is a cloud computing platform and service provided by Microsoft, offering a wide range of cloud-based services for building, deploying, and managing applications and services.

Compute Service: This service allows the deployment of virtual machine applications with various options for compute resources and capabilities.

Network Services: Azure provides features to connect, manage virtual machines, and monitor gateway protocols. It includes firewall control, load balancer, and monitoring capabilities.

Inbound and Outbound Rule Creations: Creating rules for controlling inbound and outbound traffic in Azure, specifically for virtual machines and resources within a Virtual Network.

IAM and Security Monitoring: Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls resource access. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides robust IAM capabilities. Security monitoring involves tracking resource usage and access for security purposes.

RBAC - Role-Based Access Control: RBAC in Azure allows controlling access to Azure resources based on roles, ensuring proper authorization levels for users.

In the second week, the focus shifted to Azure Virtual Machine Features:

Virtual Network (VNET): Azure VMs are deployed within VNETs, which create isolated network segments, controlling traffic flow.

Network Security Groups (NSG): NSGs act as basic firewalls, permitting or denying specific traffic based on IP addresses, port ranges, and protocols.

Public and Private IP Addresses: Azure VMs can have public IP addresses for internet connectivity and private IP addresses for communication within the VNET.

Network Security and VPN Gateway: Azure offers network security and VPN gateways for secure connections to on-premises networks, supporting various VPN configurations.

In the third week, we delved into Azure Firewall, Network Security Group, Network Traffic, and Sentinel:

Azure Firewall: Azure Firewall is a managed network security service, providing stateful inspection and filtering of traffic at the network and application layer, controlling outbound and inbound internet access.

Network Security Group (NSG): NSGs are fundamental for controlling inbound and outbound traffic, associated with network interfaces, VMs, and subnets.

Azure Sentinel: Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, offering advanced analytics, custom detection rules, incident management, and automation for effective threat detection and response.

In the fourth week, we explored Wazuh Deployment in Ubuntu Azure Machine and Adding Azure Virtual Machine as Agents:

Wazuh Deployment: Deploying Wazuh involves setting up a dedicated server or VM, choosing a compatible operating system, installing the Wazuh manager, configuring settings, integrating with Elastic Stack if needed, installing agents on servers for monitoring, registering agents, and customizing rules for specific security requirements.
These topics provided a comprehensive understanding of Azure fundamentals, virtual machine features, network security, and advanced security solutions like Wazuh and Azure Sentinel.
